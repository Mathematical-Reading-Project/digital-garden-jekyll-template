# About

This site aims to host maths book reviews that aid maths tourism and enjoyment, particularly for undergraduates and masters students but hopefully far beyond.

If there are any other maths book review sites, queries or you just want to chat please contact me at MathematicalReadingProject@gmail.com.

# How does it work

We'll put up a form which contains some prompts, you write a review answering of few of the questions, we post it (via github) to this website https://the-mathematical-reading-project.netlify.app/. If we get some engagement the website will improve I promise :D
