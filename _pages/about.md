*About*

This site aims to host maths book reviews that aid maths tourism and enjoyment, particularly for a-level and undergraduates but hopefully far beyond.

If there are any other maths book review sites, queries or you just want to chat please contact me at MathematicalReadingProject@gmail.com.

*A few random comments*

This webiste is based on a digital garden template [available on GitHub here](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template). Its a great resource although some of the ruby dependencies (bundler :( ) seem to hate apple chips... user beware. 

The general guidelines for reviews are "be positive" and "include your motivation". Hopefully this can be achieved by reviewing really good and well motivated books. Some example reviews will be included for length and a lot of this should be baked into the form.
